      <p>A chain of blocks!</p>
      <p><strong>Uhhhh...</strong></p>
      <p>Ok, ok, think of a block as a file, as a spreadsheet. And what does this spreadsheet record? Transactions! Who sent money to whom.</p>
      <p><strong>Who? Who where?</strong></p>
      <p>Anywhere! In the money system you're used to, banks keep ledgers of this stuff. An important job, maintaining ledgers! Blockchain is a technology that gives us trustworthy ledgers without needing to trust a central authority, like a bank.</p>
      <p><strong>Ok, but why separate blocks? Why chop the ledger into pieces?</strong></p>
      <p>Right. So, blockchain brings to the digital realm something that wasn't native here before: Decentralized consensus. A system of record that's reliable and incorruptible, stored on many machines around the world, maintained by incentivized strangers. Chopping the ledger into blocks is part of the clever computer-sciencey way to incentivize them. For an approachable technical explanation,

      <p><strong>Ok, so now instead of a bank knowing where all my money goes, I'm supposed to trust a bunch of strangers?</strong></p>
      <p>You trust strangers to maintain the ledger, but you don't need to let them know who you are. You don't need to "open an account" in a blockchain system, you can just use some software to create a "wallet". And if someone else sends your wallet money, that transaction gets recorded in the blockchain. You can make as many wallets as you want; they look like a string of letters and numbers like "0x1ab9..." If you're careful, you can keep keep your wallet addresses separate from your real-life identity.</p>
