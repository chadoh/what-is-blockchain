      <p>A chain of blocks!</p>
      <p><strong>uhhhh...</strong></p>
      <p>That's a surprisingly good explanation, actually! But ok, yeah, think of a block as a <em>file</em>, which mostly records <em>transactions</em>. A spreadsheet, almost. Each block is like a spreadsheet recording who sent money to whom.</p>
      <p><strong>Who? Who where?</strong></p>
      <p>Anywhere! In the money system you're used to, banks keep ledgers of this stuff. An important job, maintaining ledgers! Blockchain is a new technology that gives us that same sort of ledger, but without needing to trust a bank or anyone else.</p>
      <p><strong>Ok, we'll come back to that "not trusting anyone" thing, because the news I've seen about blockchain doesn't make me trust anyone using it. But first: you didn't explain why separate <em>blocks</em> are necessary. If blockchain is some glorified ledger system, why chop the ledger into pieces?</strong></p>
      <p>Right. So this is part of a clever computer-sciencey way to incentivize a bunch of strangers to maintain a reliable ledger without needing a central trusted source, like a bank. You don't need to understand the intricacies to use it, just as you don't need to understand car engines to drive, but if you want to learn more,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4">check out this great explainer video</a>.</p>
      <p>And yeah, the blockchain ecosystem is rife with charlatans and thieves. Not needing banks means most people in the ecosystem are basically using digital cash, so you need to be careful with your wallet. But the underlying technology still brings to the digital realm a useful thing that wasn't native here before: Decentralized consensus. A system of record that's reliable and incorruptible, stored on many machines around the world, maintained by incentivized strangers.</p>
      <p><strong>Hmm... Can you show me an example?</strong></p>
      <p>Yes! Check out these blocks from the <a href="https://ethereum.org">Ethereum</a> blockchain. This is a blockchain that stores more than just transactions, but you can worry about that later. If you <a href="https://metamask.io">install MetaMask</a> to fetch recent blocks, it will query the network. Now, if you're technically inclined, you may want to know that "the network" here specifically means MetaMask will query servers maintained by a company called Infura. This may make it seem like Infura is the new bank. But Infura could cease to exist tomorrow and the Ethereum blockchain would go onâ€”they don't own it or control it. Or rather, they own it and control it as much as a homeowner owns and controls a city.</p>
      <p>Anyhow, have a look around and get used to this whole "blocks store lists of transactions" idea. Have fun!</p>
